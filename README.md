# Mango Plugins

This repository hosts the official plugins for [Mango](https://github.com/hkalexling/Mango). Mango has a built-in MangaDex downloader, and by installing plugins, Mango can download chapters from other third-party sites. The available plugins are listed [here](https://github.com/hkalexling/mango-plugins/tree/master/plugins).

## Installation

To install a plugin, simply download the folder containing the desired plugin (e.g., `plugins/mangadex/`) and place it in the Mango plugins directory (`~/mango/plugins` by default). To download a folder without cloning the whole repository, you can use tools like [GitZip](http://kinolien.github.io/gitzip/). Mango will load the plugins in the directory automatically and you don't need to restart the server.

## Contributing
